An organization scheme that makes sense

make pyspec/

put all modules that you'd like to use in pyspec.

put __init__.py in pyspec that tells python which order to import every one.

Now you have place to host modules at. 

If you now want matlablike.py (or whatever John decides to call it) 

you run 
"import pyspec.matlablike as mt "

if you run 
"from pyspec import *" 

python should check the __init__.py file to see what order to import everyone


.datadir and anything associated needs a new home and should have no calls from h5nmr, matlablike, or nmr.
